# MorseBlue
Simple Morse Code via Bluetooth LE - Server and Client

This is a simple bluetooth app that was created so I could practice morse code with friends via bluetooth. Fun to do in class but don't use it for cheating. It's not fair if your teacher doesn't know morse code and can't catch you.
